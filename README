You may need to change the -I flag path to match where the grader's tclap is

"make all"

modify config file as needed

./Prog5 -d

Note: If a SIGHUP is sent and the config file shows a new logging file then the new logging file will be put but will only be created once there is a need to log something.
AKA the new logging file will only appear if you change the watchdir which will cause a "x file was modified" logging message and be logged.
The program waits at the "read()" function until the watchdir has any modification to it

Please email me if you have any questions.
